 TMEX Design Guide  <a href="tmex8lrr.html">Overview</a></h1>
<p>Most communication with 1-Wire devices, especially <u>i</u>Buttons, is
accomplished through some sort of temporary contact.  Since this contact
is temporary the underlying design philosophy of any 1-Wire device application
is 'try and try again'.  It must be assumed at any time the user of the application
will break contact temporarily or permanently with the 1-Wire device.  With
this in mind, TMEX provides a wide variety of application programming interface
(API) calls to verify which 1-Wire device is being communicated with and
the results of that communication.  </p>
<p>Each 1-Wire device has a guaranteed unique serial number (ROM).  TMEX
provides API calls that read these CRC verified serial numbers.  Since each
serial number is unique, multiple 1-Wire devices can be communicated with
on the same communication channel.  This channel is referred to as a 1-Wire
since communication is done over 1 wire and ground.  Each data-oriented API
call to a 1-Wire device is preceded by the unique serial number thus preventing
any ambiguity.</p>
<p>To facilitate data integrity in the 1-Wire device, all data is stored
in a structure that contains a length, data, and an inverted CRC-16 of that
length and data.  This structure is referred to as the <a
 href="udpt47ck.html"><b>Universal Data Packet (UDP)</b></a>. Since the Microsoft
Windows environment is multi-tasking, TMEX provides the ability for several
applications to communicate on the same 1-Wire network.  This is accomplished
through the use of semaphore functions that provide a 'session_handle' that
gives exclusive use of that 1-Wire network.  The time that this 'session_handle'
is valid is referred to as a Session.  To be 'friendly' to other applications
the duration of a Session should be as small as possible.  Each application
running in Microsoft Windows may have a different state so each call to the
TMEX API must provide a buffer for state variables.  </p>
<p>All of the TMEX API calls are designed such that if their operation is
interrupted no data corruption occurs.  An interruption would most likely
occur due to intermittent contact.  To complete an interrupted function,
simply call it again.  If the device does not return to the 1-Wire network
then that call was not done and the 1-Wire device has not been changed. </p>
<p>There is one exception to the rule that API calls can be interrupted,
programming EPROMs.  Any EPROM programming is destructive, meaning it uses
up data space.  To get around this TMEX has two special API calls, <a
 href="crpr5xri.html"><b>TMCreateProgramJob</b></a> and <a
 href="dopr3x66.html"><b>TMDoProgramJob</b></a>.  TMCreateProgramJob sets
up a buffer that keeps track of any writes to the EPROM without actually
doing the write.  TMDoProgramJob then proceeds to transfer the buffered changes
to the EPROM device.  TMDoProgramJob MUST complete successfully for the data
integrity of the EPROM device to remain.  TMDoProgramJob is set up such that
if it returns an ERROR it can be called again to complete the operation.
 Programming EPROMs requires special hardware.  For the PC COM port this
hardware is a DS9097E PC Serial Port Adapter with an optional but recommended
external power supply. </p>
<p>Here is a possible 1-Wire Session.  Note that all TMEX API calls are prefixed
with 'TM'.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="exst8l9q.html"><b>TMExtendedStartSession</b></a> - get permission
to communicate on the 1-Wire network.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="setu0apa.html"><b>TMSetup</b></a> - called only once at the
beginning of the application to verify that the 1-Wire network exists.</p>
    <p><a href="firs2f5a.html"><b>TMFirst</b></a>,<a href="next25ym.html"><b>TMNext</b></a>,<a
 href="stac7ui6.html"><b>TMStrongAccess</b></a>,<a href="romm1rxq.html"><b>TMRom</b></a>...
- get the unique registration number of the 1-Wire device to communicate
with.</p>
    <p><a href="crpr5xri.html"><b>TMCreateProgramJob</b></a> - called only
if the 1-Wire device is an EPROM device AND a write operation is going to
be attempted.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><a href="fifi210u.html"><b>TMFirstFile</b></a>,<a
 href="chdi23zi.html"><b>TMChangeDirectory</b></a>,<a href="defi0be6.html"><b>TMDeleteFile</b></a>,<a
 href="form2wtq.html"><b>TMFormat</b></a>... - do a file operation.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><a href="dopr3x66.html"><b>TMDoProgramJob</b></a> - called only if
TMCreateProgramJob was called.  Keep calling until it returns success.  If
the 1-Wire device loses contact, have the application force the user to make
contact again.</p>
    <p><a href="clos2m9a.html"><b>TMClose</b></a> - called only once at the
end of the application to power down the 1-Wire network. (not always applicable,
but always callable) </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><a href="ense05da.html"><b>TMEndSession</b></a> - relinquish use of the
1-Wire network.</p>
</blockquote>
