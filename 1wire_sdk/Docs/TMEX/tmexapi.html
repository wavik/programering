<blockquote>     
  <blockquote>         
    <p>The basic design of TMEX is based on the International Standards Organization
(ISO) reference model of Open System Interconnection (OSI).  Its layered
protocol includes five layers: Session layer, File Operations layer, Transport
layer, Network layer and Hardware Specific layer.</p>

<blockquote>     
  <ul>
	<li>TMEX provides many kinds of application programming interface (API)
calls to verify which 1-Wire device is being communicated with and the results
of that communication.  Most communication with iButtons is a temporary contact.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
	<li>Each 1-Wire device has a guaranteed unique serial number (ROM) and multiple
1-Wire devices can be communicated with on the same communication channel
(1-Wire Communication). TMEX provides API calls that read these CRC verified
serial numbers and each data-oriented API call to a 1-Wire device is preceded
by its unique serial number to prevent any ambiguity.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
	<li>All data is stored in the structure “ <a href="udpt47ck.html"><b>Universal
Data Packet</b></a> “. TMEX provides the ability for several applications
to communicate on the same 1-Wire network without data corruption.</li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>     
  <blockquote>         
    <p>The TMEX DLL drivers must be in a directory that can be found by the
Microsoft Windows application. The 1-Wire Drivers installation program will
automatically copy the drivers into the Windows\System sub-directory.  It
is recommended that the end user install the 1-Wire Drivers and then install
the target application.  The DLL drivers are designed such that there is
a main driver and then a series of Hardware Specific sub-drivers.</p>

  <a href="exfi97c5.html"><b>1-Wire File Structure</b></a></p>
<blockquote>     
  <blockquote>         
    <p>The 1-Wire File Structure is the foundation of the Presentation Layer
of TMEX. It provides a directory structure for data stored on a 1-Wire device,
allowing named files to be randomly accessed.  The data organization of the
1-Wire File Structure is very similar to that of a floppy disk. A sector
of a floppy roughly corresponds to a memory page of a 1-Wire device.  The
directory tells which files are stored, where the data is located in the
device, and how many pages it occupies.  The 1-Wire File Structure is carefully
designed to provide high speed and optimal performance in a Touch environment.
Every memory page can be read, CRC-checked or written without the need to
access other pages.  If a file is modified, only the affected pages need
to be rewritten.</p>
