 TMCreateProgramJob  <a href="fiop6apj.html">Overview</a>  <a
 href="fiop1g38.html">Group</a></h1>
<p>The <b>TMCreateProgramJob</b> API call starts a program job with the current
EPROM device.  This function must be called immediately before any TMEX function
that writes to an EPROM device.  The writes in the TMEX function are not actually
done, they are just logged in the program job data space.   After the TMEX
function has been completed successfully, then another specialty function
<a href="dopr3x66.html"><b>TMDoProgramJob</b></a> must be called to carry
out the EPROM programming.   EPROMs are treated differently by TMEX because
any write to an EPROM is destructive, meaning it uses up device memory. 
In NV-RAM devices, if an operation is unsuccessful then the function could
then be just called again with no ill effects.  If EPROMs were regarded in
this way then some or all of the memory space could be lost.  The second specialty
API call ,TMDoProgramJob, is called again and again by the application program
until all of the jobs are completed.  This puts the onus on the application
programmer to make sure that the EPROM device does not go away in mid write
and waste memory space.  For instance if  after doing a TMCreateProgramJob
and TMWriteFile successfully, the TMDoProgramJob comes back saying that the
device has left the 1-Wire network then the application should put up some
message saying that the device needs to come back and call TMDoProgramJob
again.  The data space needed to write EPROMs is located at the end of the
status buffer provided in the functions.   There can be only one program job
at a time.  If after TMCreateProgramJob is called, the internal ROM buffer
is changed then the program job is invalidated. See the <a

<p><b>Parameters</b></p>
<p><i>session_handle</i></p>
<p>Specifies the session handle returned from the API function <a

desired 1-Wire network port.  This parameter is required by most TMEX API
functions.</p>
<p><i>state_buffer</i></p>
<p>Specifies a pointer to a memory location that TMEX keeps all of the state
information for the 1-Wire networks. This parameter is required by most TMEX
API functions.</p>
