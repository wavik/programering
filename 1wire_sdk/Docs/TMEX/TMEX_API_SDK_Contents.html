<br>
The TMEX API is a tool for professional programmers to facilitate the
development of programs utilizing the TMEX Application Program
Interface
(API) calls. Most of the TMEX API examples contained herein came from
version
3.10 of the SDK (formerly known as the iButton-TMEX SDK). Some examples
have been removed for legacy and brevity. However, they have all been
updated
to use the most updated version of the TMEX API calls. &nbsp;Version
3.10
of the SDK will be made available for those looking for 16-bit Windows
and
DOS support, however, developers are encouraged to look at the 1-Wire
Public
Domain Kit for these platforms. The contents of the TMEX API are as
follows:<br>
<br>
1. Source code examples in C, Pascal (Borland Delphi), and Visual Basic
6.0 for 32-bit Windows platforms.<br>
2. Source code examples in C for 64-bit Windows platforms.&nbsp; The
substring "64" in the names of projects will signify they are 64-bit
examples.<br>
3. Complete SDK documentation in html format. <br>
4. Compiled versions of all of the example programs (note that the
Visual Basic run-time libraries have not been included).<br>
