 1-Wire File Structure  <a href="tmexapi.html">Overview</a></h1>
<br>
The 1-Wire File Structure is the foundation of the Presentation Layer of
the TMEX API.  It provides a directory structure for iButton data, allowing
named files to be randomly accessed as they are on a diskette.  Application
Note 114 (located here:  <u>http://pdfserv.maxim-ic.com/arpdf/AppNotes/app114.pdf</u>)
provides a basic specification of the 1-Wire File Structure.  This document
extends the basic definition to include bitmap files for large capacity iButtons,
multiple sub-directories, extended file attributes, passwords, date-stamps,
owner identification, and other useful constructs.
<p>The definitions and rules of the 1-Wire File Structure are sufficient
to store multiple files in nested directories using device capacities up
to 64K bytes.  These devices may be organized as 4...256 pages of 32...256
bytes.  The rules given in this document are scaleable to all combinations
of memory organization within this range.  (Note that in all discussions
of iButton data structure, the first available page of memory is called page
0.)</p>
<p>The TMEX API implements a subset of the following 1-Wire File Structure
specification.</p>
<p><b>Data Organization</b></p>
<p>The data organization of the 1-Wire File Structure is very similar to
that of a floppy disk.  A sector of a floppy roughly corresponds to a page
of an iButton.  The directory tells which files are stored, where the data
is located in the device, and how many pages it occupies. In this way information
can be randomly accessed for quick response.</p>
<p>The organization of data within a page of a file or directory is shown
below.  (The numbers shown assume a 32 byte page length, but the same structure
applies for devices with page lengths up to 256 bytes.)</p>
<pre><code>+-------------------------------------------------------+<br>| length | data          | cont.-  | /CRC16  | not      |<br>| binary |ASCII or binary| pointer | binary  | used     |<br>| 1...29 |               | binary  |         |          |<br>| 1 byte | 0 to 28 bytes | 1 byte  | 2 bytes | 28 to 0  |<br>+-------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<p>Each page of a file or directory begins with a length byte, contains a
continuation pointer, and ends with an inverted CRC16 check.  The continuation
pointer is the page address where the file or directory is continued.  A
continuation pointer value of 0 marks the last page. The length byte indicates
how many valid bytes a page contains, not counting the length byte itself
or the CRC.  The CRC calculation, however, also includes the length byte.
 The CRC accumulator is initialized by setting it equal to the iButton page
number. Every byte of a page is transmitted to or from an iButton least significant
bit first.  The length byte is the first to be transmitted.  Of the two CRC
bytes, the least significant will be sent first.</p>
<p>Each touch memory must be formatted before it can be used with the 1-Wire
file structure.  During the process of formatting, the root directory file
is created.  The root directory always begins in the first page of the iButton
(page 0).  The organization of data within the first page of the root directory
is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>+-------------------------------------------------------+<br>| length |control| file entries |cont.- |/CRC16 | not   |<br>| binary | data  |ASCII &amp; binary|pointer|binary | used  |<br>| 8...29 |       |              |binary |       |       |<br>| 1 byte |7 bytes| 0 to 21 bytes|1 byte |2 bytes|21 to 0|<br>+--------+-------+--------------------------------------+<br>         |       |<br>+--------+       +--------------------------------------+<br>|                                                       |<br>+-------------------------------------------------------|<br>| directory |  re- |  bitmap  | bitmap of used pages or |<br>|   mark    |served|  control | address of bitmap file  |<br>|   "AA"    | "00" | xyyyyyzp |  4 byte binary number   |<br>|  1 byte   |1 byte|  1 byte  | LS-byte/   /   /MS-byte |<br>+-------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<p>Instead of data, the directory contains management information and file
entries.  The control field of seven bytes has the same length as a file
entry.  The bitmap supports TMEX in allocation of memory space for writing
files.  In the bitmap, used pages are marked with a 1, empty pages with a
0.  The least significant bit corresponds to page 0.  This local bitmap is
only used for non-EPROM devices with less then 32 pages of data.  All other
devices have remote bitmap files.  In large NV-RAM iButton the bitmap file
page number refers to normal data space. In EPROM devices the page number
refers to status memory.  For EPROM devices the unprogrammed state is 1 and
the programmed state is 0.  Due to this constraint the bits in the EPROM
bitmap's are inverted.  An empty page has a 1 and an occupied page has a
0. </p>
<p>The most significant bit, "x", of the bitmap control byte specifies whether
the bitmap is stored immediately in the first directory packet or in a separate
file.  If this bit is a 1, the 4 byte bitmap immediately follows the bitmap
control byte.  If this bit is a 0, the two bytes following the bitmap control
byte are zero.  The "y" bits in the bitmap control byte specify directory
attributes.  These bits are from most significant to least significant.</p>
read-only : The directory that contains this attribute and all files and
sub-directories can be read but not deleted or modified.  If it is set on
the root level then the entire device is read-only.<br>
archive   : The directory that contains this attribute has had some or all
of its files modified since the last backup.<br>
system    : The directory that contains this attribute is designated to have
system files.<br>
encrypt   : The directory that contains this attribute has all of its files
encrypted.
<p>The "z" bit in the bitmap control byte is not used.  The least significant
bit "p" is an in-progress bit.  This bit can be set when doing non-interruptible
operations like file optimization.  Note that TMEX does not set this attribute
because none of its operations are non-interruptible.  The bit is cleared
after the operations are complete.</p>
<p>The next two bytes contain the starting page address and the number of
pages required by the bitmap file.  Note that the bitmap or the nameless
bitmap file is created during the process of formatting. Continuation pages
of the directory don't need a control field. This space is available to store
another file entry.</p>
<p>File entries consist of the 4-byte file name, one-byte file extension,
the starting page address where the file begins, and the number of pages
the file occupies.  This structure is shown below:</p>
<pre><code>+---------------------------------------------------------+<br>|      file name       | extension | start page | # pages |<br>| ASCII, blank filled, |  binary   |  binary    | binary  |<br>|    left justified    | aeeeeeee  |            |         |<br>|       4 bytes        |  1 byte   |  1 byte    | 1 byte  |<br>+---------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<p>File names must consist of ASCII characters only, as with DOS.  However,
if the first byte of a file entry has a value greater than 127, then it represents
the first byte of an extended directory entry.  The extended directory entry
is a 7-byte or multiple 7-byte data packet that applies to the next directory
entry. Each 7-byte data packet must have a first byte greater than 127. 
The additional bytes in an extended directory entry may be used to specify
additional file attributes, passwords, file ownership, date/time stamps,
and other special-purpose information regarding the file.</p>
<p>The 7 least significant "e" bits of the extension represent the extension
number of the file entry.  Extensions 0-99 decimal are reserved for normal
file entries, 100 for an AddFile that resides on an EPROM iButton device
 and 101 for a  Monetary File that is only created on a DS1962, DS1963, DS2422
and DS2423. The data page of the Monetary File can only be located on a page
that has a corresponding counter. If a page with a counter is not available
on the device then the Monetary File will not be created.  Extension 127
decimal designates a sub-directory.  Extensions 102-126 are reserved for
future specialty file types.  The most significant bit of the file extension
"a" is an attribute flag for the entry.  If it is set and the entry is a
normal file with extensions 0-99 then the file is read-only.  If it is set
and the entry is a sub-directory with extension 127 then the sub-directory
is hidden.   File entries denoting sub-directories contain the real "start
page" of the sub-directory file.  The "# pages" specifier for a sub-directory
entry does not contain a valid number.  It always contains 0 and need not
be updated when the length of a sub-directory file changes.  A sub-directory
file contains a back reference to the next higher directory file.  If there
is no higher sub-directory file the entry will be "ROOT".  The start page
of ROOT is always 0.  The first packet of a sub-directory file has the following
structure:</p>
<pre><code>+-------------------------------------------------------+<br>| length |control| file entries |cont.- |/CRC16 | not   |<br>| binary | data  |ASCII &amp; binary|pointer|binary | used  |<br>| 8...29 |       |              |binary |       |       |<br>| 1 byte |7 bytes| 0 to 21 bytes|1 byte |2 bytes|21 to 0|<br>+--------+-------+--------------------------------------+<br>         |       |<br>+--------+       +--------------------------------------+<br>|                                                       |<br>+-------------------------------------------------------|<br>| directory |  re- | reference to higher | start page   |<br>|   mark    |served|   directory level   | higher dir.  |<br>|   "AA"    | "00" |       ASCII         |   binary     |<br>|  1 byte   |1 byte|      4 bytes        |   1 byte     |<br>+-------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<p>Again, the numbers shown above presume a 32-byte page length, but the
basic structure applies for greater page lengths.  A continuation packet
of a root directory or a sub-directory file follows the definition of a data
packet.  It has the following structure:</p>
<pre><code>+-------------------------------------------------------+<br>| length |  file entries | cont.-  | /CRC16  | not      |<br>| binary | ASCII &amp; binary| pointer | binary  | used     |<br>| 1...29 |   (0 ... 4)   | binary  |         |          |<br>| 1 byte | 0 to 28 bytes | 1 byte  | 2 bytes | 28 to 0  |<br>+-------------------------------------------------------+</code></pre>
<h1>Features</h1>
<p>The 1-Wire File Structure is carefully designed to provide high speed
and optimal performance in a Touch environment. Every memory page can be
read, CRC-checked or written without the need to access other pages.  If
a file is modified, only the affected pages need to be rewritten.  This provides
a significant speed advantage.  Pages of a file need not be contiguous. 
Files can be extended by redefining continuation pointers.  Files can be
grouped into nested sub-directories.  Attributes defined for a directory
apply for all files within it.  The <u>i</u>Button file structure also accommodates
future types of <u>i</u>Buttons with up to 256 pages with a maximum of 256
bytes per page.</p>
<h1>Properties</h1>
<p>The notes below summarize many of the significant properties of the 1-Wire
File Structure as specified above.  These notes may be helpful in understanding
the implications of the 1-Wire File Structure with regard to data storage
and management.</p>
<ul>
	<li>The page length is derived from the family code.  <u>i</u>Buttons and
other 1-Wire devices currently available have a 32 byte page length, but
the definition of the 1-Wire File Structure also supports greater page lengths.</li>
	<li>Each page of data in the 1-Wire File Structure is a Universal Data Packet
(UDP), starting at a page boundary.  The Universal Data Packet of the 1-Wire
File Structure is somewhat limited compared with the general Universal Data
Packet.  This Universal Data Packet may be shorter but never longer than
one page.</li>
	<li>Each Universal Data Packet starts with a length byte, contains a continuation
pointer and ends with a CRC16 check.  The pointer indicates the number of
the page where a file is continued.  A continuation pointer "0" marks the
last packet of a file.</li>
	<li>The length byte indicates the number of bytes between length byte and
CRC, not counting the length byte and the CRC.  The CRC calculation includes
all of the preceding data, including the length byte.  The CRC accumulator
is initialized by setting it equal to the <u>i</u>Button page number.</li>
	<li>Each Universal Data Packet may be read and CRC-checked independently,
without reference to data from other packets.</li>
	<li>All types of files consist of one or several Universal Data Packets.
 The Universal Data Packets contain either application data (data packet)
or directory information (directory packet).</li>
	<li>Every byte of a data packet is transmitted least significant bit first.
 The length byte is the first to be transmitted.</li>
	<li>The maximum number of application data bytes within a data packet is
(page length - 4).</li>
	<li>There is exactly one main directory file in a touch memory.  This file
is called the root directory and always starts at page 0.</li>
	<li>The maximum number of entries in the first packet of a (sub)directory
file is (page length-11)/7. The maximum number of entries in continuation
packets is (page length-4)/7.</li>
	<li>The bitmap serves TMEX as a fast lookup table to find free pages.  The
data of the bitmap are treated as a 4 byte binary number.  The least significant
bit corresponds to page 0. A used page is marked with a "1", an empty page
with a "0".  The least significant byte of the bitmap is stored at the lower
address and is transmitted first.  The bitmap file must be used with <u>i</u>Buttons
of capacity greater than 32 pages.  It may be used with smaller devices depending
on formatting.</li>
	<li>The only reserved extensions are 102 - 126.  0 - 99 are file extensions,
100 for an AddFile, 101 for a  Monetary File and 127 is for sub-directories.
 </li>
	<li>It is allowed to have data packets with no data.  A packet with only
a length, pointer and CRC16 bytes is considered empty.  These empty data
packets act as pointers to the next data packet of the same file.  It is
allowed to use empty or partly filled (sub)directory continuation packets.
 Partly filled (sub)directory continuation packets contain data left justified,
i. e. the unused space must follow the CRC.</li>
