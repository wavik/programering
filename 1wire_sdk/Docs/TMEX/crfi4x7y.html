 TMCreateFile  <a href="fiop6apj.html">Overview</a>  <a
 href="fiop1g38.html">Group</a></h1>
<p>The <b>TMCreateFile</b> API function provides the information necessary
(file name and extension) to create a new file and file name in the current
directory on the current device on the 1-Wire network.  It returns a file_handle,
which can then be used later to write a file and file name to the part with
a call to <a href="wrfi8l66.html"><b>TMWriteFile</b></a>.  The new file name
is provided in the <a href="file30mx.html"><b>FileEntry</b></a> structure 'fentry'.
 Only the 'name' and 'extension' portions of FileEntry need to be set before
calling TMCreateFile.  Repeat file names are not permitted. This API returns
a file handle &gt;= 0.  Please be aware that there is a limited number of
file handles (4) that can be used at one time.  When finished writing a file,
please close the file (and free up the file handle) with<a
 href="clfi004u.html"><b>TMCloseFile</b></a>.  </p>
<p>The API call also returns the estimated maximum number of bytes, ‘maxwrite,’
available for this new file.  The ‘maxwrite’ variable has no meaning until
returned by the funtion call (it is an output variable).  The file name must
be left justified padded with spaces.  The valid file name characters are
(ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!#$%&amp;'-@^_`{}~).  The valid value
of the extension is 0-99 decimal for normal files, 100 for an ‘AddFile’ and
101 for a ‘Monetary File’.  The ‘AddFile’ is described in the API function
description of <a href="wrad82i6.html"><b>TMWriteAddFile</b></a>. The ‘Monetary
File’ is a file that is only created on a DS1962, DS1963, DS2422 and DS2423.
The data page of this file can only be located on a page that has a corresponding
counter. If a page with a counter is not available on the device, then the
‘Monetary File’ will not be created. In case of the ‘Monetary File’, some
of its other values are set upon returning from this function. In particular,
the page number where the file is copied to is set in the ‘start page’ value
of the FileEntry structure. Also, the Counter and Tamper bytes are written
into the first eight bytes of the ‘bitmap’ section of the FileEntry structure.
Note that  the Counter value reported is the current Counter value. If the
counter is a page write cycle counter as in the DS1963, then 1 must be added
to the counter value to reflect the upcoming copy. </p>

<p><b>Parameters</b></p>
<p><i>session_handle</i></p>
<p>Specifies the session handle returned from the API function <a
 href="exst8l9q.html"><b>TMExtendedStartSession</b></a> that specifies the
desired 1-Wire network port.  This parameter is required by most TMEX API
functions.</p>
<p><i>state_buffer</i></p>
<p>Specifies a pointer to a memory location that TMEX keeps all of the state
information for the 1-Wire networks. This parameter is required by most TMEX
API functions.</p>
<p><i>maxwrite</i></p>
<p>Specifies a pointer to a memory location that will contain the estimated
maximum file size to write (how much room is left on the part) after returning
from the API.  The ‘maxwrite’ variable has no meaning until returned by the
funtion call (it is an output variable).  The maxwrite size may be off by
+-28 bytes.</p>
<p><i>fentry</i></p>
<p>Specifies a pointer to a memory location that contains a <a
 href="file30mx.html"><b>FileEntry</b></a> structure.  This structure must
have the name and extension portions set before calling this API.  </p>
<p><b>Return Value</b></p>
<p>&gt;= 0 =&gt; file created, and this is the file handle</p>
<p>&lt;0    =&gt; <a href="fiop6blf.html"><b>TMEX File Operations Error Return
