 TMGetFamilySpec  <a href="fiop6apj.html">Overview</a>  <a
 href="fiop1g38.html">Group</a></h1>
<p>The TMGetFamilySpec API call copies information about the current device
on the 1-Wire network specified by 'session_handle' into the provided structure
Specification.  This information is common to all devices of the current
'family' type.  The 'family' type of a 1-Wire device is denoted by the first
byte of the serial ROM number.  For example, the family type of 10 (hex)
indicates a DS1920 Temperature iButton.</p>
<p>The information is provided in the form of a structure. This structure
includes the number and size of regular pages, the number and size of status
pages (EPROM only), maximum communications speed (0-normal speed, 1-overdrive,
2-hyperdrive), the memory type (see full description below) and a description
of the family including part number, alternate part number and a brief functional
description.</p>
<pre><b><code>typedef struct {<br>   unsigned short features[32];<br>   char description[255];<br>} Specification;</code></b></pre>
<p>(This is a packed structure on 1 byte boundaries)</p>
<p>Currently, only the first six unsigned short integers of the features
array are defined as follows: </p>
features[0] = regular pages, unsigned least significant byte first<br>
features[1] = bytes per page in regular memory<br>
features[2] = status pages, unsigned least significant byte first<br>
features[3] = bytes per page in status memory<br>
features[4] = max communication speed (regular = 0, overdrive = 1, hyperdrive
= 2)<br>
features[5] = memory type (0 = NOMEM,  1 = NVRAM, 2 = EPROM1, 3 = EPROM2,
4 = EPROM3, 5 = EEPROM1, 6 = MNVRAM, 7 = EEPROM2, 8 = NVRAM2, 9 = NVRAM3)
<br>
features[6-31] are left for future expansion
<p>Part Types</p>
1.  NOMEM – A part with no user storage space or with non-standard structure.
Only TMEX hardware specific functions apply to this type.<br>
2.  NVRAM – A part with non-volatile RAM. All TMEX API’s are supported with
the exception of the programming API reserved for EPROM parts and TMExtendedReadPage.
<br>
3.  EPROM1 – A part with Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory. Contains
an onboard 8-bit CRC data check.  All TMEX API’s apply to this type. <br>
4.  EPROM2 – A part with Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory. Contains
an onboard 16-bit CRC data check. All TMEX API’s apply to this type. <br>
5.  EPROM3 – A part with Electrically Programmable Read Only Memory. Contains
an onboard 16-bit CRC. EPROM2 and EPROM3 differ only by the location and
size of TMEX bitmap, the details of which are abstracted into the driver.
All TMEX API’s apply to this type<br>
6.  EEPROM1 – Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory. All TMEX
API’s are supported with the exception of the programming API reserved for
EPROM parts and TMExtendedReadPage.<br>
7.  MNVRAM – A part with read-only non rolling-over page write cycle counters
associated with a portion of the non-volatile RAM. Pages with the 101 extension
in the TMEX file name can only reside on counter pages, however any other
file name can also reside on counter pages. All TMEX API’s are supported
with the exception of the programming API reserved for EPROM parts.<br>
8.  EEPROM2 - Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory. On board
CRC16 for Write/Read memory. Copy Scratchpad returns an authentication byte.
All TMEX API’s are supported with the exception of the programming API reserved
for EPROM parts.<br>
9.   NVRAM2 - A part with non-volatile RAM. Contains an onboard 16-bit CRC.
All TMEX API’s are supported with the exception of the programming API reserved
for EPROM parts.<br>
10. NVRAM3 – A part with non-volatile RAM with bit accessible memory.  Contains
an onboard 16-bit CRC.  TMEX hardware specific functions and TMExtendedReadPage
apply to this type.
<p>description:  An array of characters that contains 3 fields; part number,
alternative part number and brief functional description. The fields are
delimited by commas and the string is null terminated (i.e.: DS1920,DS1820,Temperature
iButton with Trips)</p>

<p><b>Parameters</b></p>
<p><i>session_handle</i></p>
<p>Specifies the session handle returned from the API function <a
 href="exst8l9q.html"><b>TMExtendedStartSession</b></a> that specifies the
desired 1-Wire network port.  This parameter is required by most TMEX API
functions.</p>
<p><i>state_buffer</i></p>
<p>Specifies a pointer to a memory location that TMEX keeps all of the state
information for the 1-Wire networks. This parameter is required by most TMEX
API functions.</p>
<p><i>FamSpec</i></p>
<p>Specifies a Specification struct that will return a description of the
1-Wire device’s family type.  See above for more detail. </p>
<p><b>Return Value</b></p>
<p>1 =&gt; device family information is in buffer 'FamSpec'</p>
<p>&lt;0 =&gt; a FILE_OPERATIONS error has occurred</p>
