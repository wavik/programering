The 1-Wire Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows is divided into 3
sections, each representing a unique Applications Programmer Interface
(API). The first focuses on the 1-Wire .NET J# libraries and is called <a
 href="./OW.NET/html/index.html">OW.NET API</a>. The second section
focuses on a second API (pretty much a subset of OW.NET API) called <a
 href="Compact.NET/html/index.html">Compact.NET API</a>.&nbsp; This is
a limited port of OW.NET to C# and is focused on
Windows CE/Mobile/Pocket PC using the Compact .NET framework.&nbsp; For
now Maxim only provides the equivalent of the DSPortAdapter object in
the Compact.NET API.&nbsp; However, an open-source
effort is taking place to provide more pure C# classes (such as
OneWireContainers, MemoryBanks, etc).&nbsp; It is available from<a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/owdotnet/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/owdotnet/</a>.&nbsp; The third API is
the <a href="TMEX/tmexapi.html">TMEX API</a>. This is a basic
low-level, natively-compiled API that performs 1-Wire communication and
file structure primitives (as opposed to the .NET APIs that are
high-level and object oriented).&nbsp; Both the OW.NET API and the TMEX
API need the 1-Wire Drivers package
installed before the example programs will run. Compact.NET programs
can run without the 1-Wire Drivers as it can make calls to C#'s serial
port library.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
So, if using TMEX or OW.NET, please install the latest 1-Wire Drivers
installation package from <a
 href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/1-wiredrivers">http://www.maximintegrated.com/1-wiredrivers</a>
(Version 4.02 beta or higher) before using this kit. &nbsp;The 1-Wire
Drivers setup program will install the 1-Wire low-level device drivers
that are used by both APIs
to communicate through any supported 1-Wire port adapter (serial,
parallel,
or USB). &nbsp;The setup program also installs all necessary code
libraries
for the TMEX API. This includes all appropriate TMEX
API dlls and a JNI (Java Native Interface) dll that provides a Java
interface to the TMEX API. In addition, the 1-Wire Drivers setup
program installs the OneWireViewer software application. The
OneWireViewer can demonstrate and exercise the features available
on virtually any 1-Wire/iButton device.<br>
<br>
The 1-Wire SDK for Windows supports the Microsoft Windows operating
systems supported by a specific version of the 1-Wire Drivers.&nbsp;

<h2><b>Which API Should You Use?</b></h2>
The application developer is free to choose one of the three APIs
presented above. &nbsp;However, there are a few deciding factors that
can influence the choice. &nbsp;Here are a few of them:<br>
<br>
<b>1) &nbsp;Rapid Application Development. &nbsp;</b>The OW.NET API has
advantages in this area. &nbsp;This is an object-oriented, high-level
API. &nbsp;It has method calls such as <i>readDevice(),
getTemperature()</i> and <i>doADConvert()</i> that can take the place
of several TMEX API function calls. &nbsp;The TMEX API functions are
lower level and deal with sending and receiving bytes to and from
1-Wire devices. &nbsp;The programmer must write his own subroutines to
actually "get" the temperature or do an A-to-D conversion for a
particular 1-Wire device.<br>
<br>
<b>2) &nbsp;API dependencies</b>. &nbsp;The TMEX API has fewer
dependencies, so the application programmer has less to re-distribute
with his 1-Wire application. &nbsp;The OW.NET API is dependent upon the
installation of Microsoft's .NET framework version 2.0, and the J#
redistributable version 2.0 Second Edition.&nbsp; For more information
on dependencies and software redistribution with the
1-Wire Drivers, please see <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/an1740">White
Paper 6</a> "1-Wire Drivers Installation
Guide
for Windows". &nbsp;It can be found in the list of Application Notes
and White
Papers here: &nbsp;<a
 href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/appnotes10.cfm/ac_pk/1">http://www.maximintegrated.com/appnotes10.cfm/ac_pk/1</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>3) &nbsp;Supported Features</b>. &nbsp;Although both APIs support
the same 1-Wire adapters and 1-Wire features, OW.NET has more built-in
functionality. &nbsp;Since OW.NET was designed to be a high-level API
(a J# compiled version of our <a
 href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/products/ibutton/software/1wire/1wire_api.cfm">1-Wire
API for Java</a>), it supports more features than the TMEX API such as <a
 href="OW.NET/html/classcom_1_1dalsemi_1_1onewire_1_1container_1_1_one_wire_container.html">OneWireContainer</a>
objects
and <a
 href="OW.NET/html/interfacecom_1_1dalsemi_1_1onewire_1_1container_1_1_memory_bank.html">MemoryBanks</a>.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4)&nbsp; Windows CE/Mobile/Pocket PC
Development</span>.&nbsp; The Compact.NET API is perfect for
this.&nbsp; Although it only provides DSPortAdapter functionality for
now, it can be used to develop 1-Wire applications communicating
through the serial port of the development machine without any 1-Wire
Drivers installation.<br>
