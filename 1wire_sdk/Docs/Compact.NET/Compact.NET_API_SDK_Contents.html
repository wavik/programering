<br>
The Compact.NET 1-Wire API assembly library (OneWireLinkLayer.dll) is a
limited port of the OW.NET API to C# and is focused on Windows
CE/Mobile/Pocket PC using the Compact .NET framework.&nbsp; For now
Maxim only provides the equivalent of the DSPortAdapter object in the
Compact.NET API.&nbsp; However, an open-source effort is underway to
provide more pure C# classes (such as OneWireContainers, MemoryBanks,
etc).&nbsp; It is currently available from<a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/owdotnet/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/owdotnet/</a>.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The examples written for the Compact.NET 1-Wire API are linked to the
Compact .NET framework version 2.0.&nbsp; This is available as a free
download from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft's website</a>.&nbsp;
The Compact .NET 1-Wire API contents of this SDK are as follows:<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>2 example programs written entirely in C#.<br>
    </li>
    <li> A complete set of HTML documentation containing detailed
descriptions
of all of the objects, methods, and
properties included in the API.</li>
    <li>Compiled versions of all of the example programs. <br>
    </li>
    <li> The complete source code for the OneWireLinkLayer.dlll
assembly library as a Visual Studio 2005 C# project.</li>
  </ol>
