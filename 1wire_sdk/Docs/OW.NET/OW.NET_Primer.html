<h1>OW.NET API Primer &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="../1-Wire_SDK_Help.html">1-Wire
SDK Help</a></h1>
<blockquote>Communication with the 1-Wire network is through an
&#8216;adapter&#8217; (com.dalsemi.onewire.adapter.DSPortAdapter class).
&nbsp;Physically speaking, an adapter is a hardware device through
which the 1-Wire master communicates to the network of 1-Wire devices
(1-Wire network). &nbsp;Many adapters exist for the different kinds of
ports on
a PC such as the serial, parallel, or USB ports. &nbsp;Please see the <a
 href="./DotNET_Adapter_Table.html">OW.NET Adapter List</a> for a
comprehensive list of adapters available for the PC. &nbsp;The software
implementation of the adapter is <a
 href="./html/classcom_1_1dalsemi_1_1onewire_1_1adapter_1_1_d_s_port_adapter.html">DSPortAdapter()</a>.
&nbsp; The static class, &#8216;<a
 href="./html/classcom_1_1dalsemi_1_1onewire_1_1_one_wire_access_provider.html">com.dalsemi.onewire.OneWireAccessProvider</a>&#8217;
is used to get an adapter class instance. All of the adapters can be
enumerated or a specifc (or the default) adapter can be retrieved
(enumerateAllAdapters(), getAdapter(), and getDefaultAdapter()). Each
adapter may support multiple &#8216;ports&#8217; so a 1-Wire network consists of an
adapter/port combination. Here is a brief list of the operations needed
to access and use the 1-Wire network. </blockquote>
<font>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>1. Get an adapter instance<br>
2. Get exclusive use of the 1-Wire network<br>
3. Find a 1-Wire device <br>
4. Perform operations through the device&#8217;s container<br>
5. End exclusive use of the 1-wire network<br>
6. Free the port when ending application</p>
</dir>
<p>Note that &#8216;1.&#8217; and &#8216;6.&#8217; are performed only once at the beginning and
end of the application. &#8216;2.&#8217; through &#8216;5.&#8217; comprise the bulk of the
1-Wire
operations and are performed multiple times during the execution of an
application.</p>
<b>
<p>Default 1-Wire Network</p>
</b>
<dir>
<p>For .NET applications, the default 1-Wire Network (adapter on a
specific port) is retrieved<br>
through the OneWireAccessProvider method "getDefaultAdapter":</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dim adapter As
com.dalsemi.onewire.adapter.DSPortAdapter<br>
adapter = com.dalsemi.onewire.OneWireAccessProvider.getDefaultAdapter</p>
<p>This method actually retrieves the default 1-Wire Network from the
Windows system<br>
registry. More information on what these keys are, see White Paper 6:
1-Wire Drivers<br>
Installation Guide for Windows:<br>
<a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/an1740">http://www.maximintegrated.com/an1740</a><br>
<br>
Alternatively, the programmer can also retrieve a specific adapter using<br>
OneWireAccessProvider's "getAdapter" method. Here's an example that
retrieves the<br>
DS9490 adapter on port 1:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Dim adapter As
com.dalsemi.onewire.adapter.DSPortAdapter<br>
adapter =
com.dalsemi.onewire.OneWireAccessProvider.getAdapter("{DS9490}", "USB1")</p>
<p>The current adapter list is (brackets required):<br>
{DS9490}<br>
{DS9097U}<br>
{DS1410E}<br>
{DS9097E}</p>
<p>Since the adapters being used currently in the .NET version of the
1-Wire API are through TMEX, they need the brackets. Also, the port
numbers are a name/number combination.&nbsp; The names can be USB, COM,
or LPT. The numbers can be 0-15. Examples are:<br>
USB1<br>
COM1<br>
LPT1</p>
<dir>
<dir></dir>
</dir>
</dir>
<b>
<p>Access to 1-Wire Network</p>
</b>
<dir>
<p>To allow for multi-thread access to the 1-Wire network, a pair of
methods are provided in the adapter class to give exclusive access.
They are &#8216;beginExclusive()&#8217; and &#8216;endExclusive()&#8217;. It is recommended
that this pair wrap any access
to the 1-Wire network.</p>
<p>The beginExclusive method is invoked on an adapter object to obtain
a lock on the underlying physical adapter. Once the lock is owned by a
particular adapter, no other adapter instance can invoke methods that
result in communication with either the port adapter directly or the
1-Wire network it controls. Any attempt to do so results in a
OneWireException being thrown. The lock applies to other processes as
well as other threads within the same process. The lock can be freed by
either of two mechanisms. Typically, the adapter instance that owns the
lock will invoke endExclusive, voluntarily releasing the lock. Also,
the lock will automatically be freed in the event that the owning
process terminates without invoking endExclusive.</p>
<p>The boolean value passed to beginExclusive specifies whether the
caller wishes to wait until the lock is free or return immediately
regardless of the lock&#8217;s state. If block is false, beginExclusive will
immediately return true in the event that the lock was successfully
acquired and false otherwise. If block is true, beginExclusive will
attempt to acquire the lock; if it is already owned by another adapter
instance, beginExclusive blocks indefinitely until the lock has been
freed and it can claim ownership. When block is true and beginExclusive
returns normally (that is, non-abruptly), it will always return true.<br>

<b>
<p>Finding 1-Wire devices (and iButtons)</p>
</b>
<dir>
<p>Each 1-Wire device type is identified with a 1 byte &#8216;family code&#8217;.
This family code is used to provide the appropriate container and can
also be used to limit the search of the 1-Wire Network to one or more
device types (see family code list below). For example the following
code fragment will search for devices with 0x10 family code. Note that
&#8216;adapter&#8217; is a working instance of DSPortAdapter.</p>

<b>
<p>1-Wire Containers</p>
</b>
<dir>
<p>As described in the &#8216;Finding 1-Wire Devices&#8217; section, each type of
1-Wire device has a &#8216;family code&#8217; that indicates its functionality. The
adapter uses this family code to provide a &#8216;container&#8217; to interface to
it. The container (com.dalsemi.onewire.container.OneWireContainer) is
then used by th e application to manipulate the device. Each container
class has the following format OneWireContainerXX where XX is the
&#8216;family code&#8217;. For example, the DS1920 has a family code of 0x10 so the
container to use it is OneWireContainer10. The adapter will
automatically provide the correct container . If the
family code is unknown then the adapter will provide the super-class
generic
container.</p>
<p>For a list of the containers (and family codes) provided in this
API, see <a href="http://www.maximintegrated.com/an155">Application Note 155</a>:&nbsp;

Table 1).<br>

<p><font><b>Types of Containers</b></font></p>
<dir>
<p><font><b>Memory </b></font></p>
<dir>
<p><font>The base class of all containers &#8216;OneWireContainer&#8217; has a
method called &#8216;getMemoryBanks()&#8217; that returns an enumeration of memory
bank instances. A memory bank is a section of memory on a 1-Wire device
that has specific properties. For example the 1-Wire Network Address of
a device is a read-on ly bank of 8 bytes. This technique is used to get
a handle on the diverse types of memory that comprise 1-Wire devices.
There are three interfaces that the memory bank may implement. These
interfaces are hierarchical:</font></p>
<p><font><b>MemoryBank</b> &#8211; basic read/write (getSize(), read(),
write()..)<br>
<b>PagedMemoryBank</b> (extends MemoryBank) &#8211; paged read/write with
packets (getNumberPages(), readPage(), writePagePacket()..)<br>
<b>OTPMemoryBank</b> (extents PagedMemoryBank) &#8211; One-Time-Programmable,
usually EPROM (canRedirectPage(), lockPage())</font></p>
<p><font>See the example &#8216;MemoryBanks&#8217; for an example application
that
utilizes memory banks.</font></p>
<p><font>Any 1-Wire devices that contain memory can also use the 1-Wire
File system. The following classes in the com.dalsemi.onewire.utils
package
can be used just like the Java equivalient:</font></p>
<p><font><b>OWFile</b> &#8211; Like java.io.File<br>
<b>OWFileInputStream</b> &#8211; Like java.io.FileInputStream<br>
<b>OWFileOutputSTream</b> &#8211; Like java.io.FileInputStream<br>
<b>OWFileDescriptor</b> &#8211; Like java.io.FileDescriptor</font></p>
<p><font>See the example &#8216;FileApp&#8217; to demonstrate using the 1-Wire file
system. The specification for the 1-Wire file system can be found in
Application Note 114:<br>

</dir>
<p><font><b>Sensor </b></font></p>
<dir>
<p><font>A 1-Wire Sensor is a device that can make a reading or change
the state of something physical (such as a DS2413 switch). Typically
the operations of 1-Wire Sensors is memory mapped so writing to a
particular location
causes the state to change. To accommodate this type of architecture
and
reduce the number of 1-Wire operations that need to take place, a
&#8216;read-modify-write&#8217; technique is used. Each Sensor interface is derived
from a super-interface (<a
 href="./html/interfacecom_1_1dalsemi_1_1onewire_1_1container_1_1_one_wire_sensor.html">com.dalsemi.onewire.container.OneWireSensor</a>)
that contain just two methods: readDevice(), writeDevice(). The read
returns a byte array and the write takes a byte array (or for .NET
users, an array of SBytes). The byte array
is the
state of the device. The interfaces that extend this interface have
&#8216;get&#8217;
and &#8216;set&#8217; methods that manipulate the byte array. So a OneWireSensor
operation is:</font></p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p><font>1. readDevice()<br>
2. &#8216;get&#8217; and &#8216;set&#8217; methods<br>
3. writeDevice()</font></p>

<p><font><b>Overdrive Speed with 1-Wire Containers</b></font></p>
<dir>
<p><font>Most 1-Wire devices support Overdrive speed, a 1-Wire Net
communication speed that supports up to 142 k-bits/second of 1-Wire
data. The method
getMaxSpeed(), defined in <a
 href="./html/classcom_1_1dalsemi_1_1onewire_1_1container_1_1_one_wire_container.html">OneWireContainer</a>,
will tell you if you're device can support Overdrive speed.</font></p>
<p><font>Communicating with a device in Overdrive speed just requires
that you call the setSpeed(int,boolean), defined in OneWireContainer.
The boolean value indicates whether or not it is okay for the device to
fall back to a slower speed if communication fails. The DSPortAdapter
object also has a set Speed(int) method, but it is not advisable to
call this one directly. Instead, allowing the container itself to be
the only entity who manipulates the DSPortAdapter's state, you can be
assured that the two will not be
out of sync.</font></p>
<p><font>Also, if you're in a situation where you have devices on the
1-Wire Net who support Overdrive and devices that don't, it's important
to remember that regular speed communication will cause devices in
Overdrive mode to revert to regular speed. This change of 1-Wire speed
could potentially cause I /O errors on the devices that were in
Overdrive the first time they are accesses after the speed change. The
opposite situation (Overdrive communication on the same network with
devices in regular speed) is harmless. Calling
the OneWireContainer&#8217;s doSpeed() method will force a re-negotiation of
th
e 1-Wire speed. However this can be a slow procedure on some platforms
so
it should not be called indiscriminately. The OneWireContainer&#8217;s
implementation
specific methods (clock methods, temperature methods, memory methods
...)
will automatically call doSpeed() at appropriate times. </font></p>
