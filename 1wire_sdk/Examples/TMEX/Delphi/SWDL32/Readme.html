<h4>Files of the sub-directory \Examples\TMEX\DELPHI\SWDL32\:</h4>
 
<p>   &nbsp; This program is written for 32-Bit Microsoft Windows. &nbsp;The 
source code <br>
   &nbsp; is provided in Delphi 5.0. </p>
 
<p>   &nbsp; OPERATION OF 'SW'</p>
 
<p>   &nbsp; The 'SW' example program contains only one window. It displays 
the <br>
   &nbsp; information on the DS2406 Dual Addressable Switch Plus Memory such 
as :<br>
   &nbsp; TMEX Driver Version, Type Version, 1-Wire address and the status 
of the <br>
   &nbsp; Activity Latch and the Open drain outputs inside the switch. The 
Open <br>
   &nbsp; drain outputs for each DS2406 on the 1-Wire network can be independently 
<br>
   &nbsp; switched on or off whether there is one or many devices sharing 
the same <br>
   &nbsp; 1-wire port. &nbsp;The value of the Sensed Level can be updated 
by clicking<br>
   &nbsp; 'Read' button. The value of the Activity Latch can be reset by
clicking <br>
   &nbsp; 'Clear Activity Latch' button when the switch is on and its status 
can be <br>
   &nbsp; updated by clicking 'Read' button.</p>
