   This program is written for Microsoft Windows 95/NT.  The source code 
   is provided in Delphi 3.0. 

   OPERATION OF 'RAY'

   The 'RAY' example program contains three main windows. The main 'RAY'
   window provides a list of the registration numbers on the MicroLan. 
   A particular iButton can be opened for inspection of its directory by 
   double-clicking on the registration number or by clicking once on the 
   registration number and then clicking the Select button.  A sub-directory 
   can be opened in the same manner.  A file in the file list window can then 
   be selected for editing in the same way. When the file name is selected, 
   'RAY' attempts to read the file and display its contents in the 'File Data'
   window.  The file contents can be edited and the 'Accept' button is pressed
   to save the contents back to the file.  The 'File Names' and 'File Data' 
   window can be removed by pressing the 'Cancel' button.  The 'RAY' program 
   is ended by pressing the 'Exit' button on the 'Registration Numbers' window.
